## 🛠️ Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Radwa09/SkinEwithdetected.git
   cd SkinEwithdetected
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 🐍 Backend Setup (Python)

The AI vision features (Product Scanner & Face Capture) require the Python backend:

1. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-cors opencv-python easyocr pyzbar numpy requests langchain-groq langchain-core pydantic
   ```

2. **Optional: enable live Groq AI chat and recommendations**:
   ```powershell
   $env:GROQ_API_KEY="your-valid-groq-api-key"
   ```
   If `GROQ_API_KEY` is missing or invalid, SkinE automatically uses local clinical fallback recommendations and chat instead of showing an API key error.

3. **Run the backend**:
   ```bash
   python backend_app.py
   ```

## 🌐 Deployment & Vercel Troubleshooting

If you are deploying to Vercel and see "Failed to fetch" or "Scanner Error":

1. **Backend URL**: By default, the app looks for the backend at `http://localhost:5000`. If your backend is hosted elsewhere (e.g., Render, Railway), set the `VITE_BACKEND_URL` environment variable in Vercel.
2. **Mixed Content**: Vercel uses HTTPS. If your backend is only HTTP (like a local server), most browsers will block the connection. You must host your backend on an HTTPS-enabled server.
3. **Local Testing**: To test with the backend while the frontend is on Vercel, use a tool like **Ngrok** to create an HTTPS tunnel to your local port 5000 and set that as `VITE_BACKEND_URL`.
